# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This repository contains my rendition of the Etch-a-Sketch project, from The Odin Project curriculum. It's a dynamic web application that simulates the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw on a grid by moving the mouse over the cells, which then change color to visualize the drawing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** The grid is generated using JavaScript, allowing for interactive drawing.
- **Colorful Interactions:** Implements an extra challenge where cells change to a random RGB color on hover.
- **Progressive Darkening:** Each cell darkens by 10% on subsequent passes, adding depth and shade to drawings.

## Extra Credit Completion

I've enhanced the project by completing the extra credit points:
1. **Random RGB Color:** Each hover interaction changes the cell color to a random RGB value, making the drawing vibrant.
2. **Shading Effect:** Adds a shading effect where cells progressively darken with each pass, up to ten times, simulating a more realistic drawing experience.
